# BPlusTreeDB  

An implementation of a B+ tree, a self-balancing tree data structure that:  
1. Maintains sorted data order.  
2. Supports insertions and access in logarithmic time.  

For more details, refer to **documentation.txt**.  

Feel free to use this implementationâ€”just credit me as a reference.
